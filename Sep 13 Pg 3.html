    <h3>Wildfire and climte change</h3>
    <p>Last year was by far Canada's worst for wildfires, with 15 million hectares (37 million acres) of forest burned.</p>
    <p>Globally, last year was the hottest on record - driven by human-caused warming, but also boosted by a natural weather system called El Niño.
        The continuing effects of El Niño mean that 2024 could see even higher temperatures.</p>
    <h4>What is climate change?</h4>
    <p>Climate change  is the long-term shift in the Earth's average temperatures and weather conditiond.</p>

    <p>The temperature increase was driven by human-caused climate change and boosted by the natural El Niño weather phenomenon.</p>
    <p>Fires happen naturally in many parts of the world. It is difficult to know if climate change has caused a specific wildfire to spread because other factors are also relevant, such as changing land use.
        But climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires to spread more likely, according to the UN's climate body.</p>
